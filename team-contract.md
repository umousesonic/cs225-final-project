# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet once a week for a couple of hours every meeting. We will most likely be using Discord for a majority of our communicating, but might use Zoom if necessary. 
2. **Assistance** 
Teammates will be able to constantly send messages to one another through Discord, and responses should usually arrive within a couple of hours or less. 
3. **Respect** 
In order to ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak and contribute ideas, we want at least every member to be responsible for a portion of the project. This means that we each will have a certain idea implemented within our final project.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will attempt to split the project to have each member complete the section of the project that they are most efficient in. After discussing for a bit, we realized that we have a pretty wide range of strengths, and will be able to split the project pretty evenly amogst the group members.
5. **Time Commitment** 
We will expect to have around 3 - 4 hours of work per week put into the project for each group member. There are currently no time commitments that need be accounted for, but if any are to show up, we will attempt to split the unfinished work amongst those who can reasonably complete it.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If there is disagreement amongst members, we will have a voting on which idea or concept we want to continue on with for our project. If some members are unable to finish their task, other group members will communicate with them to have to see when they are able to work on it, and perhaps even help them with the task they are doing if they are able to. If there are any ongoing issues that seem to be unable to be fixed within the group, then a course staff will be informed, but we will attempt to make this the last resort.
